So my cousin wanted to play some flash games from his laptop with no internet connection and I made this to download from friv.net
It needs a file called input.txt with the shortname of the game and it will download it from the website

Might not work 100% of the time since the website gets their games from different sources but atleast it worked with 90% of the games
